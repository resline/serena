## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Unicode Character Validation ‚úÖ
```
=== UNICODE CHARACTER VALIDATION ===
--- create-fully-portable-package.ps1 ---
  [OK] No Unicode issues found
--- portable-package-windows10-helpers.ps1 ---
  [OK] No Unicode issues found  
--- windows10-compatibility.ps1 ---
  [OK] No Unicode issues found
--- corporate-setup-windows.ps1 ---
  [OK] No Unicode issues found

All scripts clean: YES
```

**Result:** All problematic Unicode characters (smart quotes, em dashes, etc.) have been successfully replaced with ASCII equivalents.

### 2. Line Ending Validation ‚úÖ
```
=== LINE ENDING VALIDATION ===
--- create-fully-portable-package.ps1 ---
  Line endings: CRLF - [OK] Correct line endings for PowerShell
--- portable-package-windows10-helpers.ps1 ---
  Line endings: CRLF - [OK] Correct line endings for PowerShell
--- windows10-compatibility.ps1 ---
  Line endings: CRLF - [OK] Correct line endings for PowerShell  
--- corporate-setup-windows.ps1 ---
  Line endings: CRLF - [OK] Correct line endings for PowerShell

All line endings correct: YES
```

**Result:** All scripts now use proper Windows CRLF line endings, eliminating cross-platform compatibility issues.

### 3. Here-String Formatting Validation ‚úÖ
```
=== HERE-STRING VALIDATION ===
Here-string analysis for create-fully-portable-package.ps1:
  Starts (@"): 4, Ends ("@): 4 - [OK] All here-strings properly balanced
Here-string analysis for portable-package-windows10-helpers.ps1:
  Starts (@"): 0, Ends ("@): 0 - [OK] All here-strings properly balanced
Here-string analysis for windows10-compatibility.ps1:
  Starts (@"): 0, Ends ("@): 0 - [OK] All here-strings properly balanced
Here-string analysis for corporate-setup-windows.ps1:
  Starts (@"): 7, Ends ("@): 7 - [OK] All here-strings properly balanced

All here-strings properly formatted: YES
```

**Result:** All here-strings are properly opened and closed with matching terminators.

### 4. Critical Error Resolution ‚úÖ
```
=== ORIGINAL ERROR LOCATION CHECK ===
Checking for line 1059 character 104 error...

Checking original error location in create-fully-portable-package.ps1...
Line 1059 content: '            Write-Host "   - Older Windows 10 detected - enhanced compatibility automatically applied" -ForegroundColor Gray\n'
Character 104: '-' (ASCII: 45) - [OK] Character 104 is ASCII: -

Original line 1059 character 104 error resolved: YES
```

**Result:** The specific error at line 1059 character 104 has been completely resolved. The Unicode em dash has been replaced with a regular ASCII hyphen.
