## Critical Fixes Applied

### ✅ Unicode Character Issues - RESOLVED
**Problem:** Non-ASCII characters (✓, ✗, ⚠) would cause display issues on Windows systems with restricted Unicode support.

**Fix Applied:**
- Replaced `✓` with `[OK]`
- Replaced `✗` with `[X]`
- Replaced `⚠` with `[WARN]`

**Impact:** All scripts now use ASCII-only characters, ensuring compatibility with:
- Windows PowerShell 5.1
- Corporate Windows environments
- Systems with restricted Unicode support
- Legacy Windows 10 installations

### ✅ Line Ending Issues - RESOLVED
**Problem:** Some files had Unix LF line endings instead of Windows CRLF.

**Fix Applied:**
- All PowerShell files now use CRLF (Windows native)
- Verified with `.gitattributes` configuration
- Automated validation prevents regression

**Impact:** Proper line ending handling prevents:
- PowerShell syntax errors
- Script execution failures
- Corporate deployment issues

```powershell
$content = @"
Multi-line content
properly formatted
"@
```
**Status:** All here-strings validated and Windows-compatible

---

## Git Configuration Validation

### ✅ .gitattributes Configuration
The repository includes proper line ending configuration:

```gitattributes
# PowerShell scripts should use CRLF line endings on all platforms
*.ps1 text eol=crlf

# Batch files should use CRLF
*.bat text eol=crlf
*.cmd text eol=crlf
```

**Status:** ✅ Properly configured to prevent future line ending issues
